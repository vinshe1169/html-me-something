            <h2 class="abc">Ingredient</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Besan/ Chickpea flour- 1/2 cup</li>
                <li>Ghee- 1 cup</li>
                <li>Oil - 1/4 cup</li>
                <li>Sugar - 1 1/2 cup</li>
             </ol>
            <h3 class="abc"> Method</h3>
            <ol>
                
               <p>Swift the flour to get rid of the lumps. Keep a tray, greased ready.
                    Place sugar in a heavy bottomed pan, with water enough to
                    immerse it. Say 1 cup of water.</p>


                <p>Boil until 1 string consistency. That is, if you check between your
                    fingers, a string will form as shown in the picture. Keep the flame in
                    medium when the syrup is nearing its stage. Swipe the back of the
                    ladle u use in the syrup for checking.</p>


                <p>Add the flour slowly stirring continuously. I used whisk for easy
                    mixing. Mix until smooth. The flame should always be medium.</p>


                 <p>Mix and keep oil and ghee ready. Start adding ghee slowly and add
                    continuously like 2-3 tblsp at a time. Keep stirring until the ghee
                    is finished.</p>


                <p>At one stage, the the colour changes to pale and frothy here and
                    there, so be alert at this time and lastly the whole mixture starts
                    frothy as shown in the picture. Also there will be a pleasant cooked
                    besan smell along with ghee smell. Add 2 tsp of sugar granules
                    and mix quickly (optional).</p>


                 <p id="var">Pour it to the greased tray and level it with a spatula. 
                    Wait until warm and cut into desired shape. Let it
                    cool down completely before transferring to the container.</p>
                
            </ol>   

            <h4 class="abc">Notes</h4>

                    <li>Keep flame always in medium to not to miss the stage.</li>
                        
                    <li>Sugar at last stage gives a great texture but its optional.
                        Use good quality ghee as the ghee lends the main flavour for this
                        sweet.</li>
